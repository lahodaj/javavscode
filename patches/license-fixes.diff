-The Eclipse Foundation makes available all content in this plug-in ("Content").
-Unless otherwise indicated below, the Content is provided to you under the terms
-and conditions of the Eclipse Public License Version 1.0 ("EPL") and Eclipse
-Distribution License Version 1.0 (“EDL”). For purposes of the EPL, "Program"
-will mean the Content.
+a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content Distributed under this Agreement, and
+b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
+i) changes to the Program, and
+ii) additions to the Program; where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution “originates” from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that are not Modified Works.
+“Contributor” means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
 
-If you did not receive this Content directly from the Eclipse Foundation, the
-Content is being redistributed by another party ("Redistributor") and different
-terms and conditions may apply to your use of any object code in the Content.
-Check the Redistributor’s license that was provided with the Content. If no such

-CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
+“Recipient” means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
 
-1. DEFINITIONS
+“Derivative Works” shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
 
-"Contribution" means:
+“Modified Works” shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified Works shall not include works that contain only declarations, interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program or Modified Works thereof.
 
-a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation
-distributed under this Agreement, and
-b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
+“Distribute” means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
 
-i) changes to the Program, and
+“Source Code” means the form of a Program preferred for making modifications, including but not limited to software source code, documentation source, and configuration files.
 
-ii) additions to the Program;
+“Secondary License” means either the GNU General Public License, Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial Contributor.
 
-where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are
-distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a
-Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone
-acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to
-the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
-conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not
-derivative works of the Program.
+2. Grant of Rights
+a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
 
-"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
+b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
 
-"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
-necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when
-combined with the Program.
+c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.
 
-"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.
+d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
 
-"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,
-including all Contributors.
+e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
 
-2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
+3. Requirements
+3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
 
-a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
-Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
-reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
-distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such
-derivative works, in source code and object code form.
+a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange; and
 
-b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
-Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed
-Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the
-Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form.
-This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the
-Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
-addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
-Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations
-which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
+b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
 
-c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to
-its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any
-Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual
-property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to
-Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of
-intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
-rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole
-responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.
-For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to
-distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
-before distributing the Program.
+i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
+ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;

+3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
 
-d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright
-rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in
-this Agreement.
+a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
+b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
+3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent, trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability (“notices”) contained within the Program from any copy of the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add their own appropriate notices.
 
-3. REQUIREMENTS
+4. Commercial Distribution
+Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (“Commercial Contributor”) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (“Indemnified Contributor”) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively “Losses”) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.
 
-A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its
-own license agreement, provided that:
+For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.
 
-a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
+5. No Warranty
+EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
 
-b) its license agreement:
+6. Disclaimer of Liability
+EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 
-i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and
-conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and
-non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and
-fitness for a particular purpose;
+7. General
+If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
 
-ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
-damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential
-damages, such as lost profits;
+If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
 
-iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by
-that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
+All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
 
-iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor,
-and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a
-medium customarily used for software exchange.
+Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version.
 
-When the Program is made available in source code form:
+Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient. No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.
 
-a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
+Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
+“This Source Code may also be made available under the following Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s), version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}.”
 
-b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
+Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
 
-Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the
-Program.
-
-Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if
-any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the
-originator of the Contribution.
-
-4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
-
-Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
-respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
-intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
-includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
-which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if
-a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such
-Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
-every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages
-and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal
-actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the
-extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in
-connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product
-offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
-relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order
-to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
-Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to
-control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
-related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in
-any such claim at its own expense.
-
-For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
-offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that
-Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties
-related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such
-Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
-Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other
-Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court
-requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
-Contributor must pay those damages.
-
-5. NO WARRANTY
-
-EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN
-"AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
-IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,
-NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each
-Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
-distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of
-rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs
-of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,
-programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
-
-6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
-
-EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
-CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
-SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
-PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
-STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY
-OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
-GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
-
-7. GENERAL
-
-If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
-law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
-terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such
-provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
-provision valid and enforceable.
-
-If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a
-cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself
-(excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)
-infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under
-Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
-
-All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to
-comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does
-not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of
-such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,
-Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
-reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement
-and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and
-survive.
-
-Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in
-order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be
-modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to
-publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.
-No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.
-The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation
-may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable
-separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a
-distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always
-be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
-received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
-Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions)
-under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b)
-above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of
-any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
-estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under
-this Agreement are reserved.
-
-This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
-intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this
-Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year
-after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in
-any resulting litigation.

-Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone
-acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to
-the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
-conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not
-derivative works of the Program.
+2. Grant of Rights
+a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.

+b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
 
-"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
-necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when
-combined with the Program.
+c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.

-2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
+3. Requirements
+3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
 
-a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
-Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
-reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
-distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such
-derivative works, in source code and object code form.
+a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange; and
 
-b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
-Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed
-Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the
-Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form.
-This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the
-Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
-addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
-Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations
-which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
+b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
 
-c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to
-its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any
-Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual
-property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to
-Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of
-intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
-rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole
-responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.
-For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to
-distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license

+a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
+b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
+3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent, trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability (“notices”) contained within the Program from any copy of the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add their own appropriate notices.
 
-3. REQUIREMENTS
+4. Commercial Distribution
+Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (“Commercial Contributor”) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (“Indemnified Contributor”) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively “Losses”) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.
 
-A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its
-own license agreement, provided that:
+For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.
 
-a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
+5. No Warranty
+EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
 
-b) its license agreement:
+6. Disclaimer of Liability
+EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 
-i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and
-conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and
-non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and
-fitness for a particular purpose;
+7. General
+If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
 
-ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
-damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential
-damages, such as lost profits;
+If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
 
-iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by
-that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
+All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
 
-iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor,
-and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a
-medium customarily used for software exchange.
+Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version.
 
-When the Program is made available in source code form:
+Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient. No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.
 
-a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
+Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
+“This Source Code may also be made available under the following Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s), version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}.”
 
-b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
+Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
 
-Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the
-Program.
-
-Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if
-any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the
-originator of the Contribution.
-
-4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
-
-Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
-respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
-intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
-includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
-which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if
-a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such
-Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
-every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages
-and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal
-actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the
-extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in
-connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product
-offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
-relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order
-to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
-Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to
-control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
-related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in
-any such claim at its own expense.
-
-For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
-offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that
-Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties
-related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such
-Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
-Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other
-Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court
-requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
-Contributor must pay those damages.
-
-5. NO WARRANTY
-
-EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN
-"AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
-IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,
-NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each
-Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
-distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of
-rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs
-of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,
-programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
-
-6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
-
-EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
-CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
-SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
-PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
-STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY
-OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
-GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
-
-7. GENERAL
-
-If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
-law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
-terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such
-provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
-provision valid and enforceable.
-
-If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a
-cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself
-(excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)
-infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under
-Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
-
-All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to
-comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does
-not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of
-such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,
-Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
-reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement
-and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and
-survive.
-
-Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in
-order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be
-modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to
-publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.
-No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.
-The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation
-may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable
-separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a
-distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always
-be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
-received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
-Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions)
-under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b)
-above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of
-any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
-estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under
-this Agreement are reserved.
-
-This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
-intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this
-Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year
-after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in
-any resulting litigation.

+          stating that You changed the files; and
+
+      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works

+          the Derivative Works; and
+
+      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
+          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must

+          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside

+          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
+          as modifying the License.
+
+      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
+      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
+      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
+      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
+      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with

+
+   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
+      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
+      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of

+      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
+
+   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
+      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
+      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
+      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
+
+   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
+      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
+      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
+      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
+      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
+      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A

+      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
+      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
+      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
+      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
+      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
+      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
+      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
+
+   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
+      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
+      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
+      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
+      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
+      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
+      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
+      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
+      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
+      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

+2. License Grants and Conditions
+--------------------------------
+
+2.1. Grants
+
+Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
+non-exclusive license:
+
+(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
+    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
+    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
+    Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
+    as part of a Larger Work; and
+
+(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
+    for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
+    Contributions or its Contributor Version.
+
+2.2. Effective Date
+
+The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
+become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
+distributes such Contribution.
+
+2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope
+
+The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
+this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
+distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
+Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
+Contributor:
+
+(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
+    or
+
+(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
+    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
+    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
+    Version); or
+
+(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
+    its Contributions.
+
+This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
+or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
+the notice requirements in Section 3.4).
+
+2.4. Subsequent Licenses
+
+No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
+distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
+License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
+permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).
+
+2.5. Representation
+
+Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
+Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
+to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.
+
+2.6. Fair Use
+
+This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
+applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
+equivalents.
+
+2.7. Conditions
+
+Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
+in Section 2.1.
+
+3. Responsibilities
+-------------------
+
+3.1. Distribution of Source Form
+
+All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
+Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
+the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
+Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
+License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
+attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
+Form.
+
+3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
+
+If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
+
+(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
+    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
+    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
+    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
+    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
+
+(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
+    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
+    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
+    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
+
+3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
+
+You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
+provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
+the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
+Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
+Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
+License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
+under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
+the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
+Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
+License(s).
+
+3.4. Notices
+
+You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
+(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
+or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
+the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
+the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
+
+3.5. Application of Additional Terms
+
+You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
+indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
+Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
+behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
+such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
+You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
+liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
+indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
+disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
+jurisdiction.
+
+4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
+---------------------------------------------------
+
+If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
+License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
+statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
+the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
+describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
+be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
+Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
+or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
+recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
+
+5. Termination
+--------------
+
+5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
+if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
+compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
+Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
+Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
+ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
+non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
+come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
+Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
+notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
+first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
+from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
+Your receipt of the notice.
+
+5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
+infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
+counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
+directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
+You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
+2.1 of this License shall terminate.
+
+5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
+end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
+have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
+prior to termination shall survive termination.

+*  Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is"       *
+*  basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or  *
+*  statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the       *
+*  Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a        *
+*  particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the     *
+*  quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.        *
+*  Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You     *
+*  (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,   *
+*  repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an   *
+*  essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is   *
+*  authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.         *
+*                                                                      *

+*  Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort      *
+*  (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any           *
+*  Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as          *
+*  permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect,         *
+*  special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character      *
+*  including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of    *
+*  goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any    *

+*  personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the       *
+*  extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some               *
+*  jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of           *
+*  incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and          *
+*  limitation may not apply to You.                                    *
+*                                                                      *
+************************************************************************
+
+8. Litigation
+-------------
+
+Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
+courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
+place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
+jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
+Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
+cross-claims or counter-claims.
+
+9. Miscellaneous
+----------------
+
+This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
+matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
+unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
+necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
+that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
+shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.
+
+10. Versions of the License
+---------------------------
+
+10.1. New Versions
+
+Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
+10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
+publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
+distinguishing version number.
+
+10.2. Effect of New Versions
+
+You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
+of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
+or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
+steward.
+
+10.3. Modified Versions
+
+If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
+create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
+modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
+any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
+such modified license differs from this License).
+
+10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
+Licenses
+
+If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
+Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the

+
+      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
+      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
+      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
+      and conversions to other media types.
+
+      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
+      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
+      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
+      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
+
+      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
+      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
+      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
+      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
+      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
+      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
+      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
+
+      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
+      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
+      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
+      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
+      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
+      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"

+      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
+
+      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
+      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
+      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
+
+   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
+      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
+      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
+      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
+      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
+      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
+
+   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
+      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
+      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
+      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
+      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

+      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
+      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
+      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
+      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
+      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
+      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
+      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
+      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
+      as of the date such litigation is filed.
+
+   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
+      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
+      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
+      meet the following conditions:
+
+      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
+          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
+
+      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
+          stating that You changed the files; and
+
+      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
+          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
+          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
+          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
+          the Derivative Works; and
+
+      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
+          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
+          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
+          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
+          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
+          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
+          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
+          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
+          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
+          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
+          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
+          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
+          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
+          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
+          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
+          as modifying the License.
+
+      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
+      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
+      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
+      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
+      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
+      the conditions stated in this License.
+
+   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
+      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
+      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
+      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
+      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
+      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
+      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
+
+   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
+      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
+      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
+      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
+
+   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
+      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
+      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
+      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
+      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
+      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
+      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
+      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
+      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
+
+   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
+      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
+      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
+      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
+      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
+      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
+      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
+      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
+      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
+      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
+      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
+
+   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
+      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
+      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
+      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
+      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
+      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
+      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
+      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
+      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
+      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

+    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
+    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
+    Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
+    as part of a Larger Work; and
+
+(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
+    for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
+    Contributions or its Contributor Version.
+
+2.2. Effective Date
+
+The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
+become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
+distributes such Contribution.
+
+2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope
+
+The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
+this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
+distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
+Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
+Contributor:
+
+(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
+    or
+
+(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
+    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
+    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
+    Version); or
+
+(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
+    its Contributions.
+
+This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
+or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
+the notice requirements in Section 3.4).
+
+2.4. Subsequent Licenses
+
+No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
+distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
+License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
+permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).
+
+2.5. Representation
+
+Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
+Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
+to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.
+
+2.6. Fair Use
+
+This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
+applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
+equivalents.
+
+2.7. Conditions
+
+Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
+in Section 2.1.
+
+3. Responsibilities
+-------------------
+
+3.1. Distribution of Source Form
+
+All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
+Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
+the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
+Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
+License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
+attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
+Form.
+
+3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
+
+If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
+
+(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
+    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
+    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
+    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
+    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
+
+(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
+    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
+    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
+    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
+
+3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
+
+You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
+provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
+the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
+Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
+Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
+License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
+under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
+the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
+Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
+License(s).
+
+3.4. Notices
+
+You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
+(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
+or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
+the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
+the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
+
+3.5. Application of Additional Terms
+
+You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
+indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
+Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
+behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
+such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
+You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
+liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
+indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
+disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
+jurisdiction.
+
+4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
+---------------------------------------------------
+
+If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
+License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
+statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
+the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
+describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
+be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
+Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
+or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
+recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
+
+5. Termination
+--------------
+
+5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
+if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
+compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
+Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
+Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
+ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
+non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
+come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
+Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
+notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
+first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
+from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
+Your receipt of the notice.
+
+5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
+infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
+counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
+directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
+You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
+2.1 of this License shall terminate.
+
+5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
+end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
+have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
+prior to termination shall survive termination.

+*  Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is"       *
+*  basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or  *
+*  statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the       *
+*  Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a        *
+*  particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the     *
+*  quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.        *
+*  Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You     *
+*  (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,   *
+*  repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an   *
+*  essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is   *
+*  authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.         *
+*                                                                      *

+*  Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort      *
+*  (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any           *
+*  Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as          *
+*  permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect,         *
+*  special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character      *
+*  including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of    *
+*  goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any    *
+*  and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party      *
+*  shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This   *
+*  limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or   *
+*  personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the       *
+*  extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some               *
+*  jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of           *
+*  incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and          *
+*  limitation may not apply to You.                                    *
+*                                                                      *
+************************************************************************
+
+8. Litigation
+-------------
+
+Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
+courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
+place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
+jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
+Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
+cross-claims or counter-claims.
+
+9. Miscellaneous
+----------------
+
+This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
+matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
+unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
+necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
+that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
+shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.
+
+10. Versions of the License
+---------------------------
+
+10.1. New Versions
+
+Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
+10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
+publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
+distinguishing version number.
+
+10.2. Effect of New Versions
+
+You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
+of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
+or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
+steward.
+
+10.3. Modified Versions
+
+If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
+create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
+modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
+any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
+such modified license differs from this License).
+
+10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
+Licenses
+
+If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
+Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
+notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.

+
+      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
+      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
+      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
+      and conversions to other media types.
+
+      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
+      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
+      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
+      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
+
+      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
+      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
+      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
+      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
+      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
+      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
+      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
+
+      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
+      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

+      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
+      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of

+      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
+
+      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
+      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
+      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
+
+   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
+      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
+      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
+      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
+      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
+      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
+
+   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
+      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
+      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
+      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
+      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
+      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
+      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
+      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
+      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
+      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
+      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
+      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
+      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
+      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
+      as of the date such litigation is filed.
+
+   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
+      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
+      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
+      meet the following conditions:
+
+      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
+          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
+
+      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
+          stating that You changed the files; and
+
+      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
+          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
+          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
+          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
+          the Derivative Works; and
+
+      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
+          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
+          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
+          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
+          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
+          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
+          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
+          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
+          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
+          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
+          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
+          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
+          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
+          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
+          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
+          as modifying the License.
+
+      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
+      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
+      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
+      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
+      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
+      the conditions stated in this License.
+
+   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
+      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
+      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
+      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
+      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
+      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
+      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
+
+   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
+      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
+      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
+      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
+
+   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
+      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
+      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
+      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
+      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
+      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
+      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
+      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
+      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
+
+   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
+      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
+      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
+      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
+      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
+      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
+      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
+      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
+      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
+      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
+      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
+
+   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
+      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
+      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
+      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
+      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
+      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
+      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
+      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
+      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
+      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

+
+      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
+      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
+      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
+      and conversions to other media types.
+
+      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
+      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
+      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
+      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
+
+      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
+      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
+      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
+      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
+      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
+      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
+      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
+
+      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
+      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

+      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
+
+      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
+      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
+      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
+
+   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
+      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
+      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
+      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
+      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
+      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
+
+   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
+      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
+      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
+      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
+      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

+      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
+      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
+      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
+      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
+      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
+      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
+      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
+      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
+      as of the date such litigation is filed.
+
+   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
+      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
+      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
+      meet the following conditions:
+
+      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
+          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
+
+      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
+          stating that You changed the files; and
+
+      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
+          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
+          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
+          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
+          the Derivative Works; and
+
+      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
+          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
+          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
+          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
+          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
+          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
+          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
+          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
+          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
+          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
+          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
+          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
+          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
+          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
+          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
+          as modifying the License.
+
+      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
+      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
+      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
+      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
+      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
+      the conditions stated in this License.
+
+   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
+      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
+      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
+      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
+      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
+      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
+      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
+
+   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
+      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
+      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
+      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
+
+   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
+      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
+      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
+      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
+      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
+      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
+      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
+      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
+      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
+
+   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
+      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
+      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
+      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
+      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
+      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
+      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
+      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
+      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
+      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
+      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
+
+   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
+      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
+      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
+      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
+      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
+      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
+      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
+      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
+      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
+      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

+
+   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
+      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
+      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
+      meet the following conditions:
+
+      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
+          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
+
+      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
+          stating that You changed the files; and
+
+      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
+          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
+          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
+          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
+          the Derivative Works; and
+
+      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
+          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
+          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
+          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
+          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
+          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
+          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
+          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
+          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
+          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
+          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
+          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
+          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
+          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
+          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
+          as modifying the License.
+
+      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
+      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
+      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
+      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
+      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
+      the conditions stated in this License.
+
+   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
+      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
+      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
+      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
+      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
+      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
+      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
+
+   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
+      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
+      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
+      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
+
+   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
+      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
+      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
+      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
+      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
+      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
+      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
+      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
+      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
+
+   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
+      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
+      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
+      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
+      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
+      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
+      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
+      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
+      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
+      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
+      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
+
+   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
+      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
+      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
+      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
+      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
+      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
+      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
+      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
+      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
+      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

+ #
+ #  NO WARRANTY
+ #
+ #  The program was produced on an experimental basis in the course of the

+ #  to users as so produced on an experimental basis.  Accordingly, the
+ #  program is provided without any warranty whatsoever, whether express,

+ #  any right of any third party.
+ #
+ #  Each user of the program will agree and understand, and be deemed to

+ #  knowledge of, the possibility of such damages at any time during the
+ #  project or thereafter.  Each user will be deemed to have agreed to the
+ #  foregoing by his or her commencement of use of the program.  The term
+ #  "use" as used herein includes, but is not limited to, the use,
+ #  modification, copying and distribution of the program and the
+ #  production of secondary products from the program.
+ #
+ #  In the case where the program, whether in its original form or
+ #  modified, was distributed or delivered to or received by a user from
+ #  any person, organization or entity other than ICOT, unless it makes or

+5. Time Zone Database
+
+  ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone
+Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database
+is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone
+Database section 7.
+
+ # 7.  Database Ownership
+ #
+ #    The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF
+ #    document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work
+ #    that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the
+ #    public domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do
+ #    not apply to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make
+ #    to it.  Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ
+ #    Database, the organization that is providing the IANA
+ #    Considerations defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of
+ #    understanding with the IETF, currently ICANN, may act in accordance
+ #    with all competent court orders.  No ownership claims will be made
+ #    by ICANN or the IETF Trust on the database or the code.  Any person
+ #    making a contribution to the database or code waives all rights to
+ #    future claims in that contribution or in the TZ Database.

+ #  Each User may also freely distribute the Program, whether in its

+ #
+ #  NO WARRANTY
+ #
+ #  The program was produced on an experimental basis in the course of the
+ #  research and development conducted during the project and is provided
+ #  to users as so produced on an experimental basis.  Accordingly, the
+ #  program is provided without any warranty whatsoever, whether express,

+ #  any right of any third party.
+ #
+ #  Each user of the program will agree and understand, and be deemed to

+ #  project or thereafter.  Each user will be deemed to have agreed to the
+ #  foregoing by his or her commencement of use of the program.  The term
+ #  "use" as used herein includes, but is not limited to, the use,
+ #  modification, copying and distribution of the program and the
+ #  production of secondary products from the program.
+ #
+ #  In the case where the program, whether in its original form or
+ #  modified, was distributed or delivered to or received by a user from

+5. Time Zone Database
+
+  ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone
+Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database
+is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone
+Database section 7.
+
+ # 7.  Database Ownership
+ #
+ #    The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF
+ #    document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work
+ #    that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the
+ #    public domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do
+ #    not apply to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make
+ #    to it.  Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ
+ #    Database, the organization that is providing the IANA
+ #    Considerations defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of
+ #    understanding with the IETF, currently ICANN, may act in accordance
+ #    with all competent court orders.  No ownership claims will be made
+ #    by ICANN or the IETF Trust on the database or the code.  Any person
+ #    making a contribution to the database or code waives all rights to
+ #    future claims in that contribution or in the TZ Database.
